# Papr Book Club 

This is a book club to read through and study the book "Is Parallel Programming Hard, And, If So,What Can You Do About It? (2nd Edition)" by Paul E. McKenney.  A book that may also be known by its alternative titles, "Commas, so many, and, all in one, peculiar, title" and "Let's make a lengthy title so it can't fit as a subsection in a markdown document".

Anyone is welcome to join.  The book will be read at hopefully a reasonable schedule.  We may need to adjust as things progress.  No one is being graded.  You will get out of it what you put into it.

The book itself is primarily in C and rather low level although the concepts should apply to a variety of languages.  I'm pretty sure it is focused on the Linux kernel.  You know what, read chapter 1 of the book if you aren't sure if you are interested.  That's quicker than me typing out all the info.

## Schedule

Goal is to read 20-40 pages every week and meet (virtually of course) to discuss.  We are skipping chapter 1 since it is just intro.  At the moment I assume we will progress linearly but we may skip around based on discussion and interest.  Homework is to be done before the meeting.

* 4/26/2021 - Review chapters 2 & 3 (they are short chapters) [Meeting link TBD based on avail. times]
  - Get the book and read (obviously)
  - Fork this repo and submit a PR to this file with your available times. (yes, I know a Wiki is probably easier, let's start this way for now)
  - Make sure you can compile and run at least some of the sample code (the repo is included with this repo as a git submodule)
* 5/03/2021 - Review chapter 4
* 5/10/2021 - Review chapter 5
* 5/17/2021 - Review chapter 6
* 5/24/2021 - Review chapter 7
* TBD

## Meetings

Meetings will be over Google Meet.  They will be one hour long.  Finding a compatible time zone will probably be impossible but we can try.  One person will be responsible for leading the discussion.  That person will need to prepare study questions, examples, etc. and be prepared.  This unlucky person may always be me or maybe some others will volunteer.  I will lead the first meeting.

Currently, we need to find a compatible time zone.  Please post your availability below, in UTC.

* Weston - 24 hours (I'll make it work, although I'd rather avoid 11:00 - 15:00 UTC if possible)
